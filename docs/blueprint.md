## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft violet (#A685E2) to evoke a sense of calm and sophistication without being dull. The association of violet with royalty also suggests the value and importance of managing finances.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F5), a desaturated shade of violet, for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Light purple (#D0BFFF), a color analogous to violet, with a different brightness, for interactive elements and highlights.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif. Use 'Inter' for both headlines and body text to ensure a clean and consistent look that supports easy readability.
- Clean and minimal layout with expenses clearly listed in columns.
- Subtle transitions and animations on user interactions to provide feedback and make the app feel more interactive.
- Use simple, intuitive icons to represent different expense categories for quick recognition.
